1. If you use a One Big Table (OBT) model, pruning files by more than two or three dimensions becomes inefficient. 
2. In contrast, using five relational tables with one or two clustered columns each allows efficient pruning across up to ten dimensions. OBT models lose the effectiveness of clustering when too many dimensions are involved.
