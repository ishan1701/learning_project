Youâ€™re tasked with designing a system to construct different types of computers
 (GamingPC, Workstation, Server) . Each computer type has common components
 (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage), but the specific configurations differ:

GamingPC: High-end GPU, RGB lighting, fast SSD.
Workstation: Powerful CPU, lots of RAM, large HDD.
Server: Dual CPUs, ECC RAM, RAID storage.


nouns- computers
(GamingPC, Workstation, Server)

CPU, RAM and Storage- these are also nouns and the classes should be created for this.

Here I need to build a computer which multiple other components.

step 0: create the components class
a. create CPU , RAM, Storage class its better to have these classes as abstract to satisfy the D of SOLID.

step 1: define the final product which needs to be created.

a. Here I want to use factory design pattern to create the computer. Hence I will define an interface named Computer.
b. Then I will defined the cncreate classes each for gamingpc, Workstation and Server

Step 2: Builder abstract class which includes the abstract method to add components for the computer

a. Here i will create a Builer class names ComputerBuilder with abstract methods for adding the components
b. Create the concrete Builder classes for each type of computers

Step 3: Create a factory which returns based on the Computer type

Step 4: Create a Director class.
a. This class will have the ComputerBuilder as the member
b. This class will have the build methos to build the computer.
