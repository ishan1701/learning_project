Here I Am  Tasked With Designing A System To Format Text In Different Styles For A Publishing Application.
 
the system should support multiple formatting strategies (e.g., uppercase, title case, lowercase) and allow the client to
 
switch between them dynamically at runtime. the formatting strategy should be applied to a given input string, and the system must be extensible to add new formatting styles later.
 

 
the goal is to use the strategy pattern to:
 

 
Encapsulate Each Formatting Algorithm As A Separate Strategy.
 
allow the client to choose or change the formatting style without modifying the core logic.
