In Python, you define a method as a property (using the @property decorator) when you want to create a read-only attribute that behaves like a regular attribute but is computed dynamically. Here are some key cases when you should define a method as a property:

1. When You Want to Compute a Value Dynamically
If an attribute's value depends on other attributes, and you donâ€™t want to store it separately, use a property.
```angular2html
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.1416 * self.radius ** 2  # Computed dynamically

c = Circle(5)
print(c.area)  # 78.54 (computed, but accessed like an attribute)

```

2. When You Want to Control Access to an Attribute
A property allows you to hide implementation details while keeping the interface simple
```angular2html
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name  # Private attribute

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name.capitalize()  # Controlled access

p = Person("john")
print(p.name)  # John (formatted output)

```


3. When You Need Read-Only Attributes
Properties prevent users from modifying an attribute directly.
```angular2html
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self._model = model

    @property
    def model(self):
        return self._model  # Read-only

car = Car("Tesla")
print(car.model)  # Tesla
car.model = "BMW"  # AttributeError: can't set attribute

```

4. When You Want to Validate or Modify Data on Assignment
You can use a setter (@property.setter) to validate or modify data before storing it.
```angular2html
class Person:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self._age = age

    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age

    @age.setter
    def age(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
        self._age = value

p = Person(30)
p.age = 25  # Allowed
p.age = -5  # ValueError: Age cannot be negative

```
5. When You Want to Execute Additional Logic on Access
You can perform logging, caching, or other operations whenever the attribute is accessed
```angular2html
class Temperature:
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self._celsius = celsius

    @property
    def fahrenheit(self):
        print("Converting to Fahrenheit")
        return (self._celsius * 9/5) + 32  # Computation + logging

t = Temperature(25)
print(t.fahrenheit)  # Converting to Fahrenheit \n 77.0

```
