1. What is the use of assertion in Python?

When creating an object, you can use assert to ensure that the parameters passed to the constructor 
meet the required conditions.
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        assert isinstance(name, str), "Name must be a string"
        assert age > 0, "Age must be positive"
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Example Usage
p1 = Person("Alice", 30)  # Works
p2 = Person("Bob", -5)    # Raises AssertionError: Age must be positive
```
2. class level attribute  inside the class

3. class method

Scenario: I have a class which represents an Item. Now the requirement is to read the file and create the object by reading line by line.
**Here the class method can be used.**


Factory Methods can be defined using class method

Class methods are often used to create alternative constructors for a class. They allow the creation of objects in different ways than the standard __init__ constructor.

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, person_string):
        name, age = person_string.split(',')
        return cls(name, int(age))

person = Person.from_string("Alice,30")
print(person.name)  # Alice
print(person.age)   # 30
```

Singleton Pattern Implementation

Class methods can help implement the singleton pattern by ensuring only one instance of a class is created.

```
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance

obj1 = Singleton.get_instance()
obj2 = Singleton.get_instance()
print(obj1 is obj2)  # True
```
question: why cls is the first param in the class method?


Answer- Because its being called by the class like `Person.from_string`. When the method is called by the onject like below
```angular2html
class Person:
    def some_method(self)

p=Person()
p.some_method
```
**In the above self is the first param in the method and in case of the class method it will be the cls as a param.**

4. static method

**In general, static methods are ideal for utility functions or logic that doesn't require access to either instance-level (self) or class-level (cls) data.**

```angular2html
class ApiOperator(BaseOperator):
    @staticmethod
    def handle_api_response(response):
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"API call failed: {response.text}")
        return response.json()

class AnotherApiOperator(BaseOperator):
    def execute(self, context):
        response = call_some_api()
        data = ApiOperator.handle_api_response(response)
        self.log.info(f"Received data: {data}")

```
* Keeps utility functions logically grouped within the operator's scope.
* If you don't need access to the attributes or methods of the class or instance, a @staticmethod is better than a @classmethod or instance method. That way it is clear (from the @staticmethod decorator) that the class' and instance's state is not read or modified. However, using a function makes that distinction even clearer.

For example in the below
```angular2html
class Product:
    tax_rate = 0.1  # Class-level attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
    
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
        """
        Calculate the discounted price given a price and discount percentage.
        """
        return price - (price * discount_percentage / 100)


# Example Usage
price = 1200
discount = 10  # 10% discount
discounted_price = Product.calculate_discount(price, discount)
print(discounted_price)  # Output: 1080.0

```
here want to provide a utility to calculate discounts. This operation doesnâ€™t depend on a specific product instance or the class itself but is related to products. A static method is perfect for this.

# Inheritance
