1. LookMl helps in create custom data models.

* So one can create a model using lookml and it will translated to the sql query.
* It is language for describing measures, calculations, aggregations and relationships in the sql 
* It creates an abstraction between the db and the user.
* It defines like how to join the tables, create a custom table or logic of the fields.
2. How it can be useful for the non-tech people?
Answer:

Below are the elements of the lookml.
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

The lowest level if lookml is **FIELDS**

* the fields are same as dimension(column of the table) and measures(aggregate functions on the column). 

Next come as **VIEWS** which are the second level of elements in the lookml.
* The view represents a table in the database.
* it contains the dimensions and measures.
* any custom dimensions or measures can be defined in the view. Below is one of the example.
```angular2html
dimension: full_name {
    type:string,
    sql: ${first_name} || ' ' || ${last_name}
}
```
Next level in lookml structure is **EXPLORE**
Explore is the way to explore the views. Its a combinations if one of more views.
```angular2html
explore: orders {
  label: "Order Details"
  description: "Explore the details of customer orders."

  join: customers {
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
    type: left_outer
    relationship: many_to_one
  }

  join: products {
    sql_on: ${orders.product_id} = ${products.id} ;;
    type: left_outer
    relationship: many_to_one
  }

  field: total_revenue {
    type: number
    sql: ${orders.total_amount} ;;
    label: "Total Revenue"
    description: "The total revenue generated by the order."
  }

  field: order_count {
    type: count
    label: "Order Count"
    description: "The number of orders placed."
  }

  always_filter: {
    filters: [ 
      {
        field: orders.status
        value: "active"
      }
    ]
  }

  access_filter: {
    field: users.region
    user_attribute: user_region
  }
}
```


To use the explore we need a **model** which is a next level.
Models uses the explore to create the joins of views.

```angular2html
# This is a LookML model file
connection: "my_database_connection" -- connection to use to query the data in the tables

include: "/views/*.view.lkml"

explore: orders {
  label: "Order Details"
  description: "Explore the details of customer orders."

  join: customers {
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
    type: left_outer
    relationship: many_to_one
  }

  join: products {
    sql_on: ${orders.product_id} = ${products.id} ;;
    type: left_outer
    relationship: many_to_one
  }

  field: total_revenue {
    type: number
    sql: ${orders.total_amount} ;;
    label: "Total Revenue"
    description: "The total revenue generated by the order."
  }

  field: order_count {
    type: count
    label: "Order Count"
    description: "The number of orders placed."
  }

  always_filter: {
    filters: [ 
      {
        field: orders.status
        value: "active"
      }
    ]
  }

  access_filter: {
    field: users.region
    user_attribute: user_region
  }
}

explore :products { }

explore: orders { }

explore: user_order_facts { }



```

And the highest level is **PROJECT.**
all the model or views files relies in onr project. Just like a git repo.

dimension and dimension_group in view file
In LookML, a dimension group is a way to define multiple related dimensions at once, 
typically for date or time fields. It groups these related dimensions under a single field and 
generates additional dimensions automatically, such as day, week, month, year, etc., based on the data type 
and granularity of the field.
```angular2html
dimension_group: created_at {
  type: time
  timeframes: [raw, date, week, month, quarter, year]
  sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
  datatype: timestamp
  convert_tz: yes
  description: "The creation timestamp of the record."
}

```
the deimensions and measures are defined in the view file of the project.


# DIMENSIONS TYPES

1. string
2. number
```angular2html
dimension: longitude {
    type: number:
    sql: ${TABLE}.longitude ;;
}
dimension: latitude {
    type: number:
    sql: ${TABLE}.latitude ;;
}
```
3. yesno
4. tier --> create the range. Something like range partition in bq
5. location -- it requires the lat/long values
```angular2html
dimension: location {
    type: location
    sql_latitude: ${latitude} ;;   -- this means the dimension is already defined in the view.
    sql_longitude: ${lomgigute} ;;
}
```
6. distance - calculate the distance between 2 points
```angular2html
dimension: longitude {
    type: number:
    sql: ${TABLE}.longitude ;;
}
dimension: latitude {
    type: number:
    sql: ${TABLE}.latitude ;;
}

dimension: distance_from_restaurant_by_user_order_location {
    type: distance
    start_location_field: restauranr_view.location -- here the location is a dimension defined in restaurant view of type location
    end_location_field: users_view.location
    units: miles
}

```
7. zipcode -- specify the zipcode


What is **drill_fields** while creating the measure
```
measure: count {
    type: count
    drill_fields: [id, name, distribution_centers.name, distribution_centers.id, inventory_items.count]
  }```
```
So drill fields are something which can be expanded more granually. So its just like adding a column in count with ading in the group by clause.

# creating a custom dimension
```
dimension: deliver_days {
    type:  number
    sql: date_diff(${created_date}, ${delivered_date},day);;
  }
```

# creating a custom measure
```angular2html

```
